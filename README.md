# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques
This repository contains code for predicting the SalePrice of houses using a Random Forest Regressor model. The model is trained on a dataset of house features and their corresponding SalePrice, and can be used to predict the SalePrice of new houses based on their features.
Files
train.csv: The training dataset containing house features and SalePrice.
test.csv: The test dataset containing house features for which the SalePrice needs to be predicted.
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file containing the predicted SalePrice for the test dataset.

Second approach is to predict SalePrice using Neural network regression model 

The predicted SalePrice for the test dataset will be saved in sample_submission_model.csv.
